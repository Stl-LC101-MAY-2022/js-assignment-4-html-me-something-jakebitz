                  As a victim of state sanctioned violence I would like to highlight the challenge that I, and others like me, face everyday as we attempt to re-enter society. I have to learn how to be a productive member of society as I learn to be an adult since I have been incarcerated since I was a child. This process is further limited by the restraints that society, landlords, employers, and banking place upon all returning citizens. I think that there is a misconception about what prisons are. Prisons are not for reform! The state does nothing to help people prepare for reentry. There are not any trauma informed people on the board or in the offices. Prison has become the mental institutions we quit funding that and a place to house our poor and cripple.    </p>

					<h2>Wash U PEP</h2>
               <p id="p2">
                  Luckily, I was in the very small minority of prisoners that had an outside entity (Washington University) bring in-person quality higher education into the prison I was at. Not that Wash U is all good because they have their faults too, but I am grateful for the opportunity. In 2019 some of my friends graduated from this program with associates degrees. <a class="link" href="https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727460014/10-missouri-inmates-receive-associate-degrees-from-washington-university">NPR Story on graduation</a>
                  One of these graduates started the STL Re-Entry Collective, along with other students and faculty of our Wash U Prison Education Program, that I am now a member in. The collective returned to me a sense of purpose, a sense of belonging in the community. This is what returning members of society feel is stripped from them. We want to belong in a community that doesn't want us there. Have any of you every loved someone whom didn't love you back?</p>

					<h2>Moving Forward</h2>
               <p id="p3">
                  I have used my connections with STL Re-Entry to start a campaign to end unhoused personâ€™s overdoses. With help from noMOdeaths.org we are going to be able to pass out pamphlets of resources and information on fentanyl overdose, along with Narcan and testing strips that can and will save lives. I am also co-creating a workshop that educates people on the cyclical and generational effects of incarceration on the children of these mothers and fathers. These are the types of people we have rejected from society because of a label. We have seen and recognized other labels that we have destroy whole groups of people. We are so divided right now by politics and race we can not see that there is a war on poor people. I will lead a charge of men and women who will fight against systems of oppression in any form. </p>
